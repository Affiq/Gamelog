In our game, we would like to introduce a throwing mechanic. These will operate with the help of the ProximityPrompt object. 
The basic premise is that if the user is within range, and presses a specific key, these will fire specific events which will form 
the basis of our throwing mechanic!

With the current game engine, we have two specific events that can be detected when a user interacts with the proximity prompt. One will
be an on-hold function (such as holding down on the E button) and the other one is an on-release function (releasing the E button) will
mirror the aiming and throwing mechanics respectively.
